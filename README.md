# tts-interface
An interface that I created for my grandfather, in order to make reading and
writing easier for his eyes. This program is applicable for anyone who is visually
impaired, feel free to fork this repository or to make use of it as you wish -
as long as it helps people, I'm happy.

Mixture of simple HTML, CSS and javascript

Back-end:
Netlify Functions, simple Javascript file that acts as a back-end server
